Design choices:

I specifically chose to make a 3D world because I am trying to get an internship at a company which uses Virtual Reality. For that reason I thought it would be much more appreciated to make a 3 dimensional world, and what better way to do that than with terrains. 

For that same reason I chose for first-person movement. Virtual Reality is of course always shown in first person. Thats why I made my fibonacci project in 3D and with first person movement. So that it already looks like something that could be virtual reality. 
I made it look like you could strap on a VR-headset and explore the world as you can already do with your PC or mobile device.

I tried to use sounds that sounded quite mysterious because that's the vibe I'm trying to create on Fibo-island.

I made the Fibonacci canvas in world space because it makes it look more like the island is trying to tell you something as opposed to a screen space canvas which makes it look like the 'game' is trying to tell you something.
